# NoSpy Exploit
makes ChromeOS forget that extentions should run.
Based off of **LTMEAT** and [https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtHang3r](ExtHang3r). 
#
# Instructions:

## Type 1. "Normal Mode" 
*(uses lots of resources, if you cannot use NoSpyBoot, please use [https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtPrint3r](ExtPrint3r) instead!*
* Step 1: Download [`nospy.html`](https://github.com/dmdtutorials-com/NoSpy/blob/main/nospy.html) and save it somewhere where you won't lose it, like in your google drive.

* Step 2: Run the `nospy.html` file and press initiate, this may take a while

* Step 3: When it's done, find your extention in the extentions bar, right click it, and click `Manage extention`

* Step 4: Scroll down and Click `Allow File URLs` Twice

* Step 5: Don't close the `nospy.html` page and you're done! *(The name of the page is supposed to be "Loading" so it doesn't stand out)*
  
## Type 2. "NospyBoot" *(uses significantly less resources when finished)*

* Step 1: Pin your spyware extention

* Step 2: Run the "Normal Mode" exploit like normal, follow along with its instructions, but make sure you click `Allow File URLs` twice.

* Step 3: Click on your spyware extention, if it doesn't load, continue to step 4, if it loads, press `Reload + Power Button` and retry the exploit from the start

* Step 4: If step 3 succeeds, stay on the page for the exploit, press ` Esc + Reload + Power Button `

* Step 5: Whenever you reach the recovery page, press ` Reload + Power Button ` within 10 seconds.

* Step 6: Once you are signed in, click on your extention and if nothing loads, or it says that Javascript is disabled or it's disabled, it worked.

* Step 7: Have fun!



*Type 2 has only been tested with Linewise, if it doesnt work on another extention, create a pull request or submit an issue :D*


# How to Disable (Type 2):
- Simply press `Reload + Power Button` and it'll reboot your chromebook back to normal.
