# NoSpy Exploit
makes ChromeOS forget that extentions should run.
#
# Instructions:

## Type 1. "Normal Mode" *(uses lots of resources)*
Simply run the exploit like normal and it'll keep your extention frozen 

## Type 2. "NospyBoot" *(uses significantly less resources when finished)*

* Step 1: Pin your spyware extention

* Step 2: Run the "Normal Mode" exploit like normal, follow along with its instructions, but make sure you click `Allow File URLs` twice.

* Step 3: Click on your spyware extention, if it doesn't load, continue to step 4, if it loads, press `Reload + Power Button` and retry the exploit from the start

* Step 4: If step 3 succeeds, stay on the page for the exploit, press ` Esc + Reload + Power Button `

* Step 5: Whenever you reach the recovery page, press ` Reload + Power Button ` within 10 seconds.

* Step 6: Once you are signed in, click on your extention and if nothing loads, or it says that Javascript is disabled or it's disabled, it worked.

* Step 7: Have fun!



*Type 2 has only been tested with Linewise, if it doesnt work on another extention, create a pull request or submit an issue :D*
