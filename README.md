# NoSpy Exploit
makes ChromeOS forget that extentions should run.
Based off of **LTMEAT** and [ExtHang3r](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtHang3r). 

*This project is a tech demo, and is not intended to be misused, and should only be used when permitted by your administrator if used in an unintentional way. I do not promote academic dishonesty, and simply want to highlight issues in Google's awful operating system*
####  
----------------------------------------
# Instructions:

## Type 1. "Normal Mode" 
*(uses lots of resources, if you cannot use NoSpyBoot, please use [ExtPrint3r](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtPrint3r) instead!*
* Step 1: Download the repository's source code and save it somewhere where you won't lose it, like in your google drive.

* Step 2: Run the `nospy.html` file and press initiate, this may take a while

* Step 3: When it's done, find your extention in the extentions bar, right click it, and click `Manage extention`

* Step 4: Scroll down and Click `Allow File URLs` Twice

* Step 5: Don't close the `nospy.html` page and you're done!
  
## Type 2. "NospyBoot" *(uses significantly less resources when finished)*

* Step 1: Pin the extention you want to disable

* Step 2: Run the "Normal Mode" exploit like normal, follow along with its instructions, but **make sure** you click `Allow File URLs` twice, otherwise this will fail.

* Step 3: Click on the extention you just pinned, if it doesn't load, continue to step 4, if it loads, press `Reload + Power Button` and retry the exploit from the start

* Step 4: If step 3 succeeds, stay on the page for the exploit, press ` Esc + Reload + Power Button `

* Step 5: Whenever you reach the recovery page, press ` Reload + Power Button ` within 10 seconds.

* Step 6: Once you are signed in, click on your extention and if nothing loads, (or it says that Javascript / The extention itself is disabled), it worked.

* Step 7: Ta-da! You just found out how bad ChromeOS is.

#### 

*Type 2 has only been tested with the extention Linewise (CRX), if it doesnt work on another extention, create a pull request or submit an issue :D*
